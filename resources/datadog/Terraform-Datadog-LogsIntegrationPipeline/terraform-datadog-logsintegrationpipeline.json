You don't need to maintain or update these types of pipelines. Keeping them as resources, however, \nallows you to manage the order of your pipelines by referencing them in your \n[datadog_logs_pipeline_order](logs_pipeline_order.html#datadog_logs_pipeline_order) resource. If you don't need the\n`pipeline_order` feature, this resource declaration can be omitted.",
