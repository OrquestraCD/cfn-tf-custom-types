    "description": "This resource provides the Subnet resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.\n\nCreates a new subnet in the specified VCN. You can't change the size of the subnet after creation,\nso it's important to think about the size of subnets you need before creating them.\nFor more information, see [VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm).\nFor information on the number of subnets you can have in a VCN, see\n[Service Limits](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm).\n\nFor the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the subnet\nto reside. Notice that the subnet doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, route tables, or\nother Networking Service components. If you're not sure which compartment to use, put the subnet in\nthe same compartment as the VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see\n[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm). For information about OCIDs,\nsee [Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).\n\nYou may optionally associate a route table with the subnet. If you don't, the subnet will use the\nVCN's default route table. For more information about route tables, see\n[Route Tables](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm).\n\nYou may optionally associate a security list with the subnet. If you don't, the subnet will use the\nVCN's default security list. For more information about security lists, see\n[Security Lists](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securitylists.htm).\n\nYou may optionally associate a set of DHCP options with the subnet. If you don't, the subnet will use the\nVCN's default set. For more information about DHCP options, see\n[DHCP Options](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingDHCP.htm).\n\nYou may optionally specify a *display name* for the subnet, otherwise a default is provided.\nIt does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.\n\nYou can also add a DNS label for the subnet, which is required if you want the Internet and\nVCN Resolver to resolve hostnames for instances in the subnet. For more information, see\n[DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm).",
