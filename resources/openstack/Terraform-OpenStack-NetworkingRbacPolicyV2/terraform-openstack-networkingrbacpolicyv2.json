Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy framework enables both\noperators and users to grant access to resources for specific projects.\n\nSharing an object with a specific project is accomplished by creating a\npolicy entry that permits the target project the `access_as_shared` action\non that object.\n\nTo make a network available as an external network for specific projects\nrather than all projects, use the `access_as_external` action.\nIf a network is marked as external during creation, it now implicitly creates\na wildcard RBAC policy granting everyone access to preserve previous behavior\nbefore this feature was added.",
